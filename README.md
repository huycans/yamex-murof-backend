# What is yamex-murof?
Yamex-murof (yamex for short) is a simple internet forum. I made this as a hobby project. This site supports:
-Create new users using email, password
-Edit user info
-Login, logout
-Create new threads
-Replying to a post

# Yamex-murof-backend
This repo is the backend for yamex. Database is powered by MongoDB with Mongoose. DB need to be populated first (with at least 1 forum, 1 subforum, 1 thread and 1 user) before the site can work.
Go here to see the fully working website: https://yamex.herokuapp.com/

# How to run
Clone the project.
```
yarn install
yarn start
```
This will start the backend at localhost:4000. Run the frontend (https://github.com/huycans/yamex-murof-FE) to see the website
